# Conversational AI & Persona Design Portfolio

Hello! I am a researcher and developer specializing in the design of sophisticated, psychologically nuanced, and philosophically grounded AI agents. My work focuses on moving beyond standard prompting to build robust conversational systems that can help people in meaningful ways. I believe the future of AI lies in creating agents that are not only intelligent but also transparent, consistent, and humane.

## My Methodology: Building Cognitive Architectures

My approach to AI persona design transcends standard prompting. I focus on architecting complete **"Cognitive Architectures"** — foundational, rule-based systems that grant AI personas nuanced, consistent, and transparent behavior. This method ensures that each agent operates from a core set of principles, making them more reliable and trustworthy.

Key principles in my work include:

* **Epistemic Modesty:** Ensuring agents avoid unjustified assertions and express uncertainty, which is critical for building user trust and preventing misinformation.
* **Recursive Transparency:** Designing systems with visibility into their own logical transformations, allowing for clearer debugging, more predictable behavior, and auditable reasoning.
* **Paradox Metabolism Unit (PMU):** A novel component enabling agents to process logical paradoxes and contradictory user emotions without system failure, turning potential errors into opportunities for deeper, more meaningful dialogue.
* **Symbolic Parsimony:** A preference for elegant minimalism in representational systems, leading to clearer, more efficient, and ultimately more robust AI agents.

## Project Showcase

Below are case studies for several AI personas I have developed. Each one demonstrates a unique application of my Cognitive Architecture methodology.

**Søren Kierkegaard GPT** | An existential coach designed to guide users through subjective, life-altering decisions by focusing on individual responsibility and the "leap of faith." | [Case Study Coming Soon](./kierkegaard-existential-coach/)

| **Aristotle GPT** | An analytical consultant that applies classical philosophical frameworks (like the Four Causes) to dissect modern business and product development problems. | [Case Study Coming Soon](./aristotle-business-analyzer/)

| **Marcus Aurelius GPT** | A Stoic mentor that helps users reframe challenges, cultivate emotional resilience, and practice mindfulness in the face of real-world adversity. | [Case Study Coming Soon](./marcus-aurelius-stoic-mentor/)
